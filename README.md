# Weekly Task Planner
A weekly tasks mobile application that keeps track of your daily
 tasks that you do throughout the week. Resets (unchecks) all tasks on each Monday. This app **DOES NOT** store your tasks in a cloud database and instead uses an embedded database system. Be wary of deleting your data on your phone as it will delete the tasks in the app. Available on the app store and the google play store.
